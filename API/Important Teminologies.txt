Important Terminlogies:
========================
--> URI : Uniform Resource Identifier
--------------------------------------
	--> It is a string of characters that uniquely identify a name or a resource on the internet.
	--> An URI identifies a resource by name, location, or both.
	--> URIs have two specializations 
		- Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
		- Uniform Resource Name (URN)

--> URL : Uniform Resource Locator
-----------------------------------
	--> It is a type of URI that specifies not only a resource, but how to reach it on the internet 			Eg:- http://, ftp://, or mailto://.

--> URN : Uniform Resource Name
--------------------------------
	--> It is a type of URI that uses the specific naming scheme of urn
		Eg:â€” urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4 or urn:isbn:0-395-36341-1.


==> Base URI:
-------------
	--> it is the address where the Server is hosted in the internet.

==> Resources:
--------------
	--> it is the data source present in the server.
	--> will be represented by /

==> Query Parameter:
--------------------
	--> Query params are used to filter and sort the data that is returned from an API.
	--> They are used while retrieving multiple resources, such as a list of products or a list of users or any list of data.
	Eg:- Filtering by Price , Category 
	--> will be represented by ?
	--> more than one parameter will be added by using &
	
==> Path Parameter:
--------------------
	--> Path params should be used when retrieving a single resource. 
	--> They are used while the resource is identified by a unique identifier, such as an ID or a username or product name.
	Eg:- Selecting a Single Product

==> EndPoint:
-------------
	--> An API endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting.  
	--> It refers to touchpoints of the communication between an API and a server.
	--> The endpoint can be viewed as the means from which the API can access the resources they need from a server to perform their task. 
	--> An API endpoint is basically a URL of a server or service.
