Test Scenario:
---------------
	-idea of what we are going to test
	-high level Testcase.
Test Case:
-----------
	-idea of how we are going to test
	-it includes test case (tc) name, test data, expected & actual results, status, etc
Test Data:
-----------
	-actual input to be use in the application for testing
Defect:
--------
	-when the expected and actual is not matching it is a defect
	-when the application does not conform to the requirement specification
Bug:
-----
	-the tester raises a defect to developer then it is called as bug



Type of testing:
=================

1) Black Box testing:
----------------------
	- done by testers
	- without knowing the internal coding knowledge of the application
	- User Perspective
2) White box testing:
-----------------------
	- done by developers
	- by knowing the internal coding knowledge
	- glass box testing, clear box testing, structural testing
	- developer perspective
* Grey Box testing:
-------------------
	- done by testers
	- by knowing the internal coding knowledge
	- user perspective with some internal access

3) Positive testing:
--------------------
	- testing with valid input data
	- to determine what system supposed to do
	- helps to check whether the application is justifying the requirements or not
 
4) Negative testing:
---------------------- 
	- testing with invalid data
 	- to determine what system not supposed to do
	- helps to find the defects from the software

5) Formal testing:
------------------
	 - preplanned procedures and proper documentation

6) Informal testing:
--------------------
	 - not following the procedure and not documented

7) smoke testing:
-----------------
	 - day zero check
	 - to make sure that the build received from the development team is testable or not
	 - basic functionalitites 
	 - validate the stability of build
	 - build level test
	 - helps to not wasting time in whole application when the key features not working properly
 
8) Regression testing:
----------------------- 
	- adding new feature may impact the old feature
	- testing new feature alone not sufficient
	- solution? - validate the entire application
	- validate the end to end scenarios(cover all functionalities)
	- whenever a new functionalities added regression testing should be done
	
9) Sanity testing:
-------------------
	- done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application 
	   without going deeper
	- subset of regression testing
	- validate the main functionalities
	- time constraint

10) Monkey testing :
--------------------
	- performing abnormal activites	to validate the stability of the application

11)Beta Testing:
-----------------
	- done by a limited number of end users before delivery
	- done in the client place.

12) Live environment testing:
-----------------------------
	- after release -Bug leakage 

13) Retest:
-----------
	- to ensure the bug fixed or not
