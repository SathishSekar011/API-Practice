1. Insprint in Agile:
======================
	• To develop and automate user stories in the same sprint, is called in-sprint automation.
	• If there are 4 User stories in a sprint-We will write a skeleton scripts for the User stories
	 which we are going to automate it in this sprint. 
	• In a 2 weeks sprint, for 6 days developer will Develop the application 
	 7th day the build is delivered to Automation team.
	• After that we will execute the scripts.

2. Outsprint or n-1 Sprint:
=============================
	• To automate user stories for the previous sprint, is called out-sprint automation.
	• Say there were 4 User stories from previous Sprint (Sprint1) which could be automated. 
	• I will automate it in Sprint 2, which is called as n-1 or outsprint automation.
	• In my previous Sprint i.e., Sprint 1, I will be working on the framework setup.

3. Velocity:
=============
	Total Number of user story points consider in a particular sprint (We can say 40 Points)

4. Capacity:
=============
	• Total no of working days*Total no of resources*Total number of working hours(PD) = Capacity
		--> Capacity= 10*7*8

5. Risk Based Testing:
========================
	- Identifying the functionalities which seems to cause failures to the application 
	  and then testing those functionalities.

6. Bug Leakage:
===============
	- Bug missed by testing team while testing and found by the end user in Live Environment

7. Bug Release:
================
	- Releasing the application to the Live Environment with the known bugs

8. Defect Age:
===============
	- It is the time interval between date of defect detection and date of defect closure.
	       • Defect Age = Date of defect closure – Date of defect detection
	       • Eg, A defect was found and reported on 17 May 2020 and it was fixed on 22 May 2020
			the defect age is 5 days

9. HotFix:
===========
	- A bug which needs to handle as more than high priority bug and needs to be fix it immediately

10. RTM:
=========
	- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) 
 	- trace the requirements - done by the testing side by matching the requirement with test cases

11. Test Suite:
================
	- Test Suite is a collection of test cases

12. Test Strategy:
=====================
	• It is a high-level document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product 
	    and achieve the goals.
	• It is developed by project manager.
	• Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as a base.

13. Test Environment:
======================
	- It is the combination of hardware and software on which Test Team performs testing
