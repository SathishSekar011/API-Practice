Testing Techniques:
===================

1)Equivalence partitioning Technique:
=====================================
	- test cases are equally divided based upon positive and negative inputs
	- valid and invalid inputs
	- age factor for exam ==> 18 to 30
	- <18     ==> 16,10,8   -- negative inputs
	- 18 - 30 ==> 19,25,28	-- positive inputs
	- >30	  ==> 31,33,54  -- negative inputs


2)Decision Table Technique:
===========================
	- dealing with combinations of inputs
	- have to consider conditions(input) and actions(output)

Example:- Login validation:
---------------------------
	-->Conditions 1: valid username - valid password - Click Login
             -- Actions 1: Display home page and Execute
	-->Conditions 2: invalid username - valid password - Click Login
	     -- Actions 2: Display Error message as invalid username

3)State Transition Technique:
=============================
	- pick test cases from the application we need to test different system transitions
	- an application gives different output for the same input depending on 
	    what has happened in the earlier state.
Example:
---------
	--> invalid username and password -3 times - account blocked until change password

4)Boundary Value Analysis:
=========================
	- based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions
	- Every partition has its maximum and minimum values (boundary values)
Example:-
----------
	--> enter an amount between 18 to 30
		- 16,17,18,19,20
		- 28,29,30,31,32

5)Error Guessing Technique:
===========================
	- find bugs in software application based on testers prior experience
	- don't have to follow any specific rules

6)Ad-hoc Testing:
===================
	- an informal testing type quite opposite to the formal testing 
	- randomly test the application without following any documents and test design techniques
	- primarily performed if the knowledge of testers in the application under test is very high
	- randomly test the application without any test cases or any business requirement document
