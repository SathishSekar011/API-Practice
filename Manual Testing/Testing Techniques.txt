Testing Data Design Techniques:
================================

	- to prepare data that covers all the scenarios of testing

1)Equivalence Class partitioning Technique(ECP):
================================================
	- test cases are equally divided into various classes based upon positive and negative data
	- using Equivalence partitioning Technique we can reduce number of test cases

	Eg :- 21 to 50
		Class1 ==> < 21     ==> 18 , 15 , 17
		Class2 ==> > 50     ==> 51 , 54 , 58
		Class3 ==> 21 - 30  ==> 31 , 34 , 37
		Class4 ==> 31 - 40  ==> 33 , 36 , 38
		Class5 ==> 41 - 50  ==> 45 , 47 , 49



2)Boundary Value Analysis(BVA):
================================
	- based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions
	- Every partition has its maximum and minimum values (boundary values)

	Eg :- 21 to 50
		21 (Lower boundary Value)   --> 19,20 --> Negative data
					    --> 21,22 --> positive data
		50 (Higher boundary Value)
					    --> 51,52 --> Negative data
					    --> 48,49 --> Positive data

	*==> ECP and BVA will be used to prepare test data for Input domain testing where the values will be verified in text boxes or input fields


3)Decision Table Technique:
===========================
	- also called as Cause-Effect Table
	- dealing with combinations of inputs
	- have to consider conditions(input) and actions(output)


4)State Transition Technique:
=============================
	- this technique will be used when the build is having different states of transition
	- pick test cases from the application we need to test different system transitions
	- an application gives different output for the same input depending on 
	    what has happened in the earlier state.
Example:
---------
	--> invalid username and password -3 times - account blocked until change password


5)Error Guessing Technique:
===========================
	- find bugs in software application based on testers prior experience
	- don't have to follow any specific rules
