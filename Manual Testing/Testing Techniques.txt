Testing Data Design Techniques:
================================

	- to prepare data that covers all the scenarios of testing

1)Equivalence Class partitioning Technique(ECP):
================================================
	- test cases are equally divided into various classes based upon positive and negative data
	- using Equivalence partitioning Technique we can reduce number of test cases

	Eg :- 21 to 50
	Class1 ==> <21	==> 19,18,11
	Class2 ==>21-30 ==> 22,25,28
	Class3 ==>31-40 ==> 34,32,37
	Class4 ==>41-50 ==> 42,45,48
	Class5 ==> >50	==> 53,55,58
		

2)Boundary Value Analysis(BVA):
================================
	- based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions
	- Every partition has its maximum and minimum values (boundary values)

	Eg :- 21 to 50
		==> 18,19,20,21,22	
		==> 48,49,50,51,52
	*==> ECP and BVA will be used to prepare test data for Input domain testing where the values will be verified in text boxes or input fields


3)Decision Table Technique:
===========================
	- also called as Cause-Effect Table
	- dealing with combinations of inputs
	- have to consider conditions(input) and actions(output)


4)State Transition Technique:
=============================
	- this technique will be used when the build is having different states of transition
	- pick test cases from the application we need to test different system transitions
	- an application gives different output for the same input depending on 
	    what has happened in the earlier state.
Example:
---------
	--> invalid username and password -3 times - account blocked until change password


5)Error Guessing Technique:
===========================
	- find bugs in software application based on testers prior experience
	- don't have to follow any specific rules
