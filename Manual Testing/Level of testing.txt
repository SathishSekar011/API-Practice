	-testers do test to validate the stability of app
	-Based on Black Box Techniques
		top down approach - higher modules to lower modules
		bottom up approach - lower modules to higher Modules
		big bang approach - integrated modules


3) System testing:
==================
	-Done by Testers
	-To check Complete Appplications
	-based on Black Box Testing Technique
Types of System Testing:
-------------------------
	• Functional Testing---Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing
	• Usability Testing

	• Security Testing

4) UAT - user acceptance testing:
