System Testing:
===============
--> GUI Testing
--> Usablity Testing
--> Functinal Testing
--> Non-Functional Testing


--> GUI Testing:
=================
	- Graphical User Interface Testing is the process of Testing User Interface of the application.
	- we'll mainly focus on look and feel of UI like 
		-- testing size,position,colour of particular element
		-- testing screen with different resolutions
		-- image clarity
		-- allignment , spelling of text

--> Usablity Testing:
=====================
	- to check how easily an end user can able to understand and operate the application.
	- we are going to check whether the options provided is helpfull or not
		-- User Manuals
		-- help menu

--> Functional Testing:
========================
	- checking the functionality or feature of the application
	- focuses on requirements of client

	> Object Properties Testing
	> Database Testing
	> Error Handling
	> Calculation or Manupulation Testing	
	> Links Testing
	> Cookies and Sessions


  > Object Properties Testing:
 ------------------------------
	- Checking the properties of particular objects in Application like
		-- text box enabled or not
		-- text box allows special characters
		-- is drop down multi select
		-- is radio button works properly


  > Database Testing / Backend Testing :
  --------------------------------------
	- we are going to check the communication of UI with Database
	- DML operations(Data Manupulation Language)
		-- inserting / submitting data
		-- retriving data
		-- updating data
		-- deleting data
	- grey box tesing
		-- from UI sending datas(Black box)
		-- from Database writing queries and manupulating data tables(White box)

  > Error Handling:
  -----------------	
	- Verifying error messages in application.
		-- readable , understandable , simple and precise , content


  > Calculation or Manupulation Testing:
  --------------------------------------
	- verifying calculations in application

  > Links Testing:
  ----------------
	--> Links Existence - placement of links in application
	--> Links Execution - navigation functionality of links
	
	Types of Links:
	     -- Internal Link
	     -- External Link
	     -- Broken Link


  > Cookies and Sessions:
  -----------------------
	cookies --> temporary files created by browser
        session --> time slot created by server to close the session after timeout


--> Non-functional Testing:
============================
	- checking behaviour of application
	- once application is stable we do non-functional testing
	- focuses on expectations of client
	
	> Performance Testing (Load Testing , Stress Testing , Volume Testing)
	> Security Testing
	> Recovery Testing
	> Compatablity Testing
	> Configuration Testing
	> Installation Testing
	> Sanitation / Garbage Testing
