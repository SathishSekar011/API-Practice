Object cloning:
===============
	--> we can create exact copy of an object using clone() method present in class Object of java.
	--> clone() method copies the values of an object to another object and saves the extra processing task for creating the exact copy of an object.
	--> clone() method does not invoke any constructor.

Step 1 : Create a class and oveeride clone() method

Step 2 : implement Clonable interface or else JVM will throw CloneNotSupportedException

Step 3 : Create object for the class in child class 

Step 4 : call clone() method in child class to copy the created object to a new object
