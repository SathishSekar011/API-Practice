Abstraction
-------------
hiding the implementation details or business logic details. 

Types of abstraction:
----------------------
partial abstraction 
Fully abstraction

partial abstraction(abstract class):
-------------------------------------  
contain both abstract and non abstract methods
contain keywords extends
use a keyword abstract in both class and abstract method
we cant create object 
Dont have any default return type

fully abstraction(Interface):
-----------------------------
contain only the  abstract methods
contain keywords implements
use a keyword interface instead of class 
we cant create object 
Default return type is public abstract





Abstract Method : we can't write logics
		  it should not be private
		  it must be created only inside abstract class

Abstract Class 	: we can't instantiate the abstract class(Object Creation)

Interface	: we can't instantiate the interface(Object Creation)
		: we can't write logics for methods in an interface
