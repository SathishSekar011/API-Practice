Inheritance:
------------
we can accesss one class property(method) from another class using extends keyword.


It use a keywords extends , implements

Parent Class / Super Class : from which properties are given 
Child Class / Sub Class : which inherits properties from parent class


Syntax:
========
parent:
-------
public class ParentClass{
	}

Child Class:
-------------
public class ChildClass extends ParentClass{
     }


Types of  inheritance:
=======================
Single inheritance:
-------------------
	- a single child getting access from a single parent

Multilevel inheritance:
-----------------------
	- a child class will access a parent class and that parent class will access their parent class and so on like a chain of inheritance
 
Hierarchical inheritance:
-------------------------
	- more than one child class accessing a single parent

Multiple inheritance:
---------------------
	- a single child class getting access from more than one parent class at same time

Hybrid inheritance:
-------------------
	- Combination of Hierarchical and Multiple inheritance


Multiple Inhereitence is not possible in Java by using Class

Reasons:

(i) Priority problem

(ii) Syntax error(By using extends keyword we cannot access two class parallely)


Why we go for inhereitence:
---------------------------
reusable code purpose .
memory wastage is low.
