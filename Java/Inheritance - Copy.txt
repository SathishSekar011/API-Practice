Inheritance:
------------
we can accesss one class property(method) from another class using extends keyword.


It use a keywords extends , implements

Parent Class / Super Class : from which properties are given 
Child Class / Sub Class : which inherits properties from parent class


Syntax:
========
parent:
-------
public class ParentClass{
	}

Child Class:
-------------
public class ChildClass extends ParentClass{
     }


Types of  inheritance:
=======================
Single inheritance:
-------------------
Combinations of one parent class and one child class.

Multilevel inheritance:
-----------------------
More than one parent class accesing the child class in a tree level structure
 
Hierarchical inheritance
-------------------------------
Combination of  one parent  and more than one child.

Multiple inheritance:
---------------------
More than one parent class access the child class parallely at a time.

Hybrid inheritance
-------------------
Combination of Single and Multiple inheritance


Multiple Inhereitence is not possible in Java by using Class

Reasons:

(i) Priority problem

(ii) Syntax error(By using extends keyword we cannot access two class parallely)


Why we go for inhereitence:
---------------------------
reusable code purpose .
memory wastage is low.
