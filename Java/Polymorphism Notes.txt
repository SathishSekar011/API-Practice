Polymorphism:
-------------

One method that can be executed in many ways is called polymorphism.
                           (or)
Executing methods in more than one forms.

poly- many
morphism- forms

Two types of Polymorphism:
===========================

1.Method Overloading or Compiletime Polymorphism.

2.Method Overriding or RunTime Polymorphsim.

1.Method Overloading:
=====================
same method name with different arguments in a single class.
                              (or)
When we are going to overload a method again and again with same method name by different its arguments.       
the arguments depends on data type, datatype order, datatype count.

Same Classname
Same methodName
Different Arguments

Example - int id, float num, long phoneNumber, String name.
-------

2.Method Overriding:
====================
when we are not satisfied with the parent class method, 
we can create the same method in our child class 
and we can write our required business logics.

Different Classname
Same methodName
Same Arguments
