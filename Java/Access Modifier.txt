Access Modifiers:
==================
1) abstract:
============
==> Method : --> we can't able to write logics for an abstract method
	     --> abstract methods can't be private --> should be public
	     --> abstract method can be created only inside an abstract class or interface

==> Class  : --> we can't able to create object for that class
	     --> able to write both abstract and non-abstract methods

==> Variable:--> we can't able declare an variable to an abstract variable	

2) static:
===========
==> Method : --> we don't need an object to evoke the method
	     --> to call a non-static varible inside a static method we must have to create object for 		 that class
	     --> to call a static method in another class ==> ClassName.methodName();

==> Class  : --> we can't declare a class to be static

==> Variable:--> we can able to call the variable without object


3) final:
==========
==> Method : --> we can't able to override the method
==> Class  : --> we can't able to inherit the class
==> Variable:--> we can't able to change the value
